"""
Fareground Agent Framework — Active Run Registry

Detaches agent execution from the HTTP/SSE connection that started it.

When a client POSTs a message, the orchestrator run is spawned as a top-level
asyncio Task owned by the registry, not by the request. Events are fanned out
to any number of subscriber queues. If a subscriber disconnects (client
navigates away, SSE cancelled), its queue is removed — but the producer task
keeps running until the agent loop completes naturally or is explicitly
cancelled via AgentService.cancel_run(). Events continue to be persisted to
the DB by the engine throughout.

This is the single fix that makes research / investigator / intelligence /
fareground sessions survive page navigation.
